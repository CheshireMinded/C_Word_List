# C_Word_List
Spell Check Program in C

In this lab we were asked to create a spell checking program based on character distance in the strings entered (Hamming distance).  A given English word list was provided, as well as a English dictionary, for sorting of words, and the lab to be performed correctly.  There was also extra credit opportunities provided, which I took advantage of: creating an additional English dictionary input file, inappropriate word file, and a Spanish dictionary input.  In my program, the person deciding to use the program has the opportunity to choose “yes/no” for the inappropriate words, then go on to choose the one file input for English words, or multiple file inputs, or Spanish words.
